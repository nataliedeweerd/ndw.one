                <p>This internal site is a staff-management solution which allows staff members to sign in/out of the building with a pin code. The time a staff member signs in and out is recorded, and a full fire safety list is available in emergency situations, which list all staff currently in the building.</p>
                <p>Visitors can also use this system to sign into the building; they simply input their name and who theyâ€™re here to see, and an email automatically gets sent to the staff member to let them know that there is a visitor waiting for them. Visitors are also added to the fire safety list.</p>
                <p>Within the admin area, HR is able to add staff holidays, and sick days, as well as other special days such as maternity leave.</p>
